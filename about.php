    <!-- Bio and Journey -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’m Caleb Orukwo—a seasoned Web Developer, Web App Expert, and Business Builder driven by the power of technology. My journey into the digital world began not with formal training, but with pure curiosity back in secondary school. I was fascinated by how computers worked and what could be built with them—long before I knew what terms like “programming” or “web development” meant.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        That early spark eventually became a career path. Over the years, I’ve honed my technical skills, taken on real-world challenges, and built digital products that solve meaningful problems—especially for everyday Nigerians. What drives me is the opportunity to turn ideas into tools that help people grow, earn, and live better.
